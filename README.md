# Exploring Machine Learning and Neural Networks

This is just a collection of small ML-related projects I worked on for fun and to familiarise myself with ANNs and machine learning algorithms. So far, this includes:

1. An elementary feedforward neural network with one hidden layer that predicts sex based on weight and height
2. A Hopfield network for image memory recall
